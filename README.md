## What is Health Vault?

Health Vault is a web system connected to the blockchain that aims to facilitate the secure recording of health information. Through it, a user can provide personal information they would like others to know in an emergency, such as allergies. This data is encrypted on the blockchain, utilizing its decentralized and secure structure, so that institutions or individuals can access it when needed. In addition to providing general information about their conditions, the user can also record more sensitive information and choose a special key to keep it encrypted and secure, granting access only when desired and to specific individuals.

### Live Without Worries

Do you have any allergies? Have you undergone any major surgeries? If you are unconscious, anyone can access the website to check your information. This ensures that first responders have the most important information about you immediately.

### How Does It Work?

It's very simple! You just need to create a wallet on the blockchain. On the website, you can create your medical records and define them as private or public.

### What Is the Difference Between a Public and a Private Record?

Public information can be accessed more easily. These details can be accessed by anyone who knows your username and CPF (Brazilian ID number). A public record is ideal for your most important information, such as an allergy to a specific medication.

Private records, on the other hand, are for your more sensitive information. In addition to your username and CPF, you will also create a personalized password to protect this record. Furthermore, you can limit the number of times a doctor, for example, can view this information. You can create as many private records as you want. They are ideal for storing your most sensitive and specific information.
