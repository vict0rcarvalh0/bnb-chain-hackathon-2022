# Health Vault
ðŸ“œ Health Vault is a web system connected to the blockchain that aims to facilitate the secure recording of health information. Through it, a user can provide personal information they would like others to know in an emergency, such as allergies. This data is encrypted on the blockchain, leveraging its decentralized and secure structure so that other institutions or individuals can access it when needed. In addition to providing general information about their conditions, the user can also record more sensitive information and choose a special key to keep it encrypted and secure, granting access only when desired and to specific individuals.

## Backend Health Vault
ðŸ’» Health Vault aims to be an API that handles information, business rules, and works in conjunction with a database and the blockchain. For this purpose, the API is built using Node.js and various NPM packages, as well as working with Smart Contracts and utilizing the Sqlite database.
